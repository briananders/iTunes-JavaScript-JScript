iTunes-JavaScript-JScript
=========================

Manage iTunes on Windows using JavaScript with the iTunes SDK


Each .js file is a different script that will help you manage your Windows iTunes tracks. Make sure you open the file in any text editor and read the commented out section at the top. It will tell you the expected behavior of the script, including if it works for highlighted tracks or just all the tracks.


If the script does something destructive, like remove a character from track title, make sure that you set the variables correctly.

i.e.
  var RemoveFromFront = (The number of characters you wish to remove from the front of the title);
  var RemoveFromBack = (The number of characters you wish to remove from the back of the title);


After you're set to go. Just double click, and it should do the magic that you're looking for.
